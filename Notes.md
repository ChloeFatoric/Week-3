Issues
So many...
Had to estimate orientation since I wasn't smart enough to think of doing it when I was actually at the cemetery.
Wasn't sure how to tell the materials of the gravestones. They all just looked like rock??
Finding the right shape to code some of the stones was really difficult, especially for the monument I was logging last. 
Kept finding new things that improved the quality of the report, but I couldn't go back and improve the others I had already submitted.
In therms of what year the stones were erected, I had no clue, so I just put the year and month that the person had died. People usually get burried relatively soon after they die...
Forgot to measure the hight of one of my stones so I had to omitt that 
I couldn't measure the height of the monument since it was just too tall
Completely failde the 3D imaging. Loads of error messages about focal points, overlapping(?) and not having enough pictures, which I realized would be an issue as soon as I read the instructions for this weeks work
Eventually, when trying different things, I couldn't even close the program, so I had to force close
